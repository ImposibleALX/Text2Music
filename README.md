## 🎵 What is Text2Music?  

Text2Music is a **fun and experimental mini-project** that turns text into **unique melodies** using MIDI notes. Each character maps to a musical note, allowing you to **"hear"** your words in a completely new way.  

> ⚠️ **Not a serious music tool** – Just a fun experiment created with ChatGPT, Wikipedia, and some improvisation!

3️⃣ **Click "Generate Melody"** to hear your text as music.  
4️⃣ *(Optional)* Record your melody with **Chrome Audio Capture**.
